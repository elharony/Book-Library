# Book Library | Your Reading Assistant
A React App to help you manage your Book Library; By dividing your books into `Currently Reading`, `Want To Read`, `Read` or `None` if you didn't decide yet!

## Setup Instructions
- `git clone https://github.com/elharony/Book-Library.git`
- `cd Book-Library`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
Your browser will open A Live Version of your Book Library!
> If you are using `yarn`, you can use `yarn install` and `yarn start` instead of using `npm`!

## How it works?
The Book Library isn't really customizable yet, but it will be. Its data is generated from `src/BooksAPI.js` API file, this file is retrieving the data by fetching this URL `https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com` . This can be customizable if you replaced the `api` variable with your own custom API URL, but make sure that it doesn't conflict with the current scripts.

## Contributing
This is a Project in the `Front End Web Developer Nanodegree` with Udacity, so it is more of an exercise to apply what I've learned so far. So, any contributing won't be approved.
